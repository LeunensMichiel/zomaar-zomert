  "content": "<0>On the occasion of the annual fair in Sint-Anna-Pede, 24 years ago, the idea was born from the Zomaar youth club to organise an event during the annual fair. In July 1998 Zomaar Zomert was born.</0><0> The first edition of the party weekend was an unexpected success. Since then, the event has grown steadily. Names like Kate Ryan, 2Fabiola, Sam Gooris, Get Ready and Avalonn all liked to perform at our festival. The success led to the establishment of a non-profit organisation around our project in 2012. This way, the existence and sustainability of the project was assured.</0><1/><0> Every year, we do our best to make Zomaar Zomert a successful festival weekend for everyone to enjoy. This would not have been possible without the current and past crewmembers, all of the volunteers, our partners and the support of municipality Dilbeek.</0>"
