              Zomaar zomert is located in the heart of Sint-Anna-Pede in
              Itterbeek.
              <br />
              <br />
              Our tent is located east of the well-known Sint-Anna church which
              can be found in Pieter Bruegel&apos;s paintings and opposite of
              the restaurant De Noa.

          <Card title="Where to park">
            <p>
              The entire centre of Sint-Anna-Pede will be closed off. The
              easiest way to park is at either end of the Rollestraat or
              Herdebeekstraat and walk around 5 to 10 minutes to the festival.
              Other valid options are the Lossebaan, Plankenstraat and the Oude
              Geraardsbergsebaan.
              <br />
              <br />
              There&apos;s no paid parking so you&apos;ll have to park in the
              street.

          <Card title="Public transportation">
            <p>
              The easiest way to get to the festival is by bus{' '}
              <strong>118</strong>. It&apos;s a small walking distance to the
              Rollestraat from there.
              <br />
              <br />
              Other options are bus <strong>141/142</strong> if you come from
              the south (Vlezenbeek, Herdebeekstraat), and{' '}
              <strong>117/810/127/128</strong> if you come from the north
              (Ninoofsesteenweg).
              <br />
              <br />
              If you come by train, the easiest way to get here is by taking bus
              117 or 810, but 127/128 are valid options as well.
              <br />

            <p>
              Like every festival, we try to improve our carbon footprint every
              year for a greener planet.
              <br />
              <br />
              Drinks are only served in reusable cups or corresponding beer
              glasses. We also try to minimize our water usage and want to
              encourage everyone to come by bike, public transport, on foot or
              by carpooling. At the end of the festival, all waste is recycled
              and the meadow is cleaned accordingly so no plastic is left
              behind.
